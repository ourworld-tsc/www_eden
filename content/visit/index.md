# A Token for Co-Ownership

We are introducing a token called EDEN. EDEN Tokens are not crypto currencies, they are pre-purchase tokens of OurParadise and represent ownership/utilization in the ecosystem. You can always re-sell your EDEN tokens or use them to participate in the OurParadise World.

# Not For Profit

The OurParadise locations will be owned by not-for-profit entities to make sure that all stays protected for ever. All assets are owned by non profits but the utilization is 100% for OurParadise for 33-66-99 years (renewable). This allows us to create value for the future of our planet and ourselves.
