<p>
Michamvi is an amazing location on the Island, it has incredible hotels around and stunning beaches.
The inner side (left side) at low tide, gives room for a huge beach with absolute white sand.<br>
It's also home to amazing mangroves, just next to our location, the location is absolutely stunning.
We have +-20.000m2 at the beach, and 10.000m2 on a hilltop with amazing views of the sea around.<br>
This is an amazing place to live parts of the year or relax after a stay at our healing clinic or resort on the other side of the island.
