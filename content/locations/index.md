### Chumbe Island

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
6 km south of Stone Town, surrounded by pristine coral reefs, Chumbe Island Coral Park is one of the world's most successful ecotourism projects. In 1994 the reef surrounding Chumbe island was created as Tanzania's first Marine National Park. The island itself, covered with lush mangrove forest, is a designated forest reserve.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Chumbe Island Coral Park won the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Award in 1999, in recognition of seven years of conservation work carried out in cooperation with local fishermen, now retrained as marine wardens.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Chumbe island contains a lighthouse, built by the British in 1904 and still operational, a ruined Mosque, and the lighthouse keeper's house, now converted into a spectacularly-built education center and restaurant.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Visitors can come for the day to snorkel over the incredible coral reef, which contains over 90% of all coral species ever recorded in East Africa. The reef, declared the 'world's best shallow water coral reef' by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, is home to over 370 species of fish, turtles, and dolphins. Guided walks are also available through the island's coral rag forest, interspersed with intertidal pools and huge baobab trees, which supports a unique flora and wildlife population including the rare - and enormous - coconut crab.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
But to experience Chumbe Island properly, stay the night in one of the seven 'eco-bandas' that nestle in the forest. Each is a two-story, private cottage constructed out of local materials and decorated with shells, driftwood, and colorful local fabrics.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Water and energy on Chumbe are self-sustaining and provided by nature - the roofs of the bandas and the education center have been designed to catch and filter rainwater, which is then heated by solar power. Beds are high in the palm-thatch roof, with a personal air-conditioning system that involves raising and lowering the front wall of the bedroom like a portcullis!
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
All profits from tourism on Chumbe Island are reinvested into the conservation and education programs operating in the Park, and the island is staffed and managed by local Zanzibaris from the fishing community, with voluntary support from overseas experts.

### Mbweni Ruins & Botanical Gardens

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Right now this location is an operational super nice boutique hotel. This boutique hotel resort is only 15 min away from Stone Town, is in front of one of the absolute nicest beaches at this side of the island. The hotel today has 13 rooms today and will be upgraded to more rooms in a sustainable way.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The resort place is very uniquely positioned, only 15 min away from the airport and stone town, yet it's an absolutely stunning and quiet place at the beach. It's positioned next to an old Oman style hotel and has 150m of beach front.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The resort is a jungle place, there are more than 280 different tree species (incl. 80  different types of palm trees), some of them very old and even unique on the island. The place allows us to go back in time but yet still has all the conveniences of modern times.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The resort is also the HQ of OurWorld Concept which is an innovative approach to provide for a better, more regenerative world. The resort will be used to come together with change makers in the world, in combination with our retreats on the Nile.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
OUR-PARADISE Creation & Healing Center is an unbelievably rich place from a historic perspective. It's home of amazing ruins, see below which can be used for events, the plan is to transform the ruins back to their original glory. They date from 1870.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The healing center and resort is on 22.000m2 land and connected to an amazing beach with lots of mangroves around.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
There are beautiful islands in front, we have boats and even a trimaran at the resort.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
These are used to bring us to the rich nature around us.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
In front of the hotel there is amazing wildlife in the ocean, there are hundreds of dolphins around.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
 Healing center will be built and will have the most amazing technology (ancient and new wisdom) for body, mind and spirit available. The therapies available are literally life saving or complete rejuvenation. 
 </p>

The Nile is a super beautiful and incredibly energy rich location. The Nile has always played an important role in global shifting situations. The Nile is fundamentally important and can use some help right now.

### Tanzania & Zanzibar Farms

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
OUR-PARADISE Farming projects, larger scale Regenerative Farming, Hemp, … Hemp is unbelievable to “grow” our own future OUR-PARADISE Villas and Bungalows.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Tanzania is the cradle of human civilization and is also one of the start of the Nile, the Nile brings life to large parts of Africa and ends in Egypt, which is also one of our smaller locations.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar/Tanzania is a super safe & fertile area, thanks to the climate ideal for farming. Zanzibar/Tanzania still has a very low GDP per capita (about 1000 USD per person per year) and has been seriously hit because of Covid. By leveraging some of its natural resources Tanzania and Zanzibar can become an example to the rest of the world how regenerative agriculture and regenerative internet can provide for a sustainable form of value creation.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar/Tanzania have enough natural resources to be independent for its own direct needs, healthy non GMO modified food is the future for a better world.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We are buying +100.000m2 farming land in Zanzibar and + 5,000,000 m2 farming land in Tanzania, with the purpose to protect and provide value for the Tanzania and Zanzibar communities.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
This land will be protected property, and can never be abused in any possible way. The land can only be used for:
</p>

- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Regenerative organic farming</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Working with local communities (Social Inclusion projects) Empower local communities to build a resilient(safe & secure), prosperous and regenerative daily/ food & dairy product supply chain.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Education projects to do with regenerative farming and regenerative internet (EarthSchool/ElementSchool)</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Research projects and programs experimenting with the best regenerative food and agriculture practices.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Conscious living in mobile structures, 100% eco friendly in balance with the organic farming</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Keep the benefit of the farming in Zanzibar and for the people of Zanzibar (local economies)</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Farming of Internet Capacity (provide energy to the Regenerative Zanzibar Internet)</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
People who live around the Farming projects can find work and education on the land.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
How can we help
</p>

- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Local farmers don’t have enough knowledge how to produce the right foods and other natural resources.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>A lot of land is wasted and sold to external investors for the wrong reasons.  The island is growing fast, more protection is needed asap.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>A lot of water is wasted and not used properly.</p>
