### Chumbe Island

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
6 km south of Stone Town, surrounded by pristine coral reefs, Chumbe Island Coral Park is one of the world's most successful ecotourism projects. In 1994 the reef surrounding Chumbe island was created as Tanzania's first Marine National Park.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Chumbe Island Coral Park won the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Award in 1999, in recognition of seven years of conservation work carried out in cooperation with local fishermen, now retrained as marine wardens.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Visitors can come for the day to snorkel over the incredible coral reef, which contains over 90% of all coral species ever recorded in East Africa. The reef, declared the 'world's best shallow water coral reef' by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, is home to over 370 species of fish, turtles, and dolphins.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
But to experience Chumbe Island properly, stay the night in one of the seven 'eco-bandas' that nestle in the forest. Each is a two-story, private cottage constructed out of local materials and decorated with shells, driftwood, and colorful local fabrics.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Water and energy on Chumbe are self-sustaining and provided by nature - the roofs of the bandas and the education center have been designed to catch and filter rainwater, which is then heated by solar power.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
All profits from tourism on Chumbe Island are reinvested into the conservation and education programs operating in the Park, and the island is staffed and managed by local Zanzibaris from the fishing community, with voluntary support from overseas experts.

### Mbweni Ruins & Botanical Gardens

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Today, this location is an operational eco-friendly boutique hotel in front of one of the absolute nicest beaches at this side of the island
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The resort is a quiet, beach-front jungle hideaway, a home to more than 280 different tree species (including 80  different types of palm trees).
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The resort is also the HQ of OurWorld Concept – an innovative approach to co-creating a better, more regenerative world. The resort will be used to come together with change makers from around the globe, in combination with our retreats on the Nile.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The Mbweni Ruins & Gardens are unbelievably rich from a historical perspective. They are home to amazing ruins dating from 1870 – which are perfect for events and gatherings – and the plan is to transform the ruins back to their original glory.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
A healing center will be built and will host incredible technology (both ancient and new wisdom) for body, mind, and spirit . The therapies available are literally life saving or complete rejuvenation. 
 </p>

### Egypt Nile River

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The Nile is not only gorgeous but also an incredibly energy-rich location. The river has always played an important role in global shifting situations.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We operate 4 boats on the Nile in the original Dahabiya style. Each boat has solar and is made as organic as possible. The Nile is an incredibly fertile area in Africa and is fundamental for the survival of millions of people, today it's not going well enough, education and concrete action is needed now.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Our Impact activities for Egypt include knowledge-creation and awareness education for the farmers along the Nile, farming projects for organic food and hemp to show the economic feasibility, carbon credit harvesting, practical digital education material, stopping the pollution of the Nile and the burning of sugar cane, and inviting experts to come and stay at our facilities to do practical research and help create educational content.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Today already we have four boats (movable platforms for authentic experiences) with a 30-person team. The boats together total 44 sleeping rooms and 4 educational rooms, along with solar energy and water filtration.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We're leveraging these boats for the expansion of OurWorld Ecosystem and beyond. Train the Trainer (two-week) sessions will permit us to train those who feel the calling around OurWorld, and allow them to go into the world, advocate, and expand our communities. Additionally, we organize retreats for investors, business people, and change-makers on the Nile, an extremely powerful energy instrument.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Ultimately, we want to empower any other changemakers to use our platform and organize events – it's proven to be incredibly impactful.

### Tanzania & Zanzibar Farms

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
OurParadise Farming projects are for the purpose of large-scale regenerative farming.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Tanzania is the cradle of human civilization and is also one of the start of the Nile. The Nile brings life to large parts of Africa and ends in Egypt, which is also one of our smaller locations.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar/Tanzania is a super safe & fertile area, and thanks to the climate, it is ideal for farming. Zanzibar/Tanzania still has a very low GDP per capita (about 1.000 USD per person per year) and has been seriously hit because of COVID. By leveraging some of its natural resources, Tanzania and Zanzibar can become an example to the rest of the world how regenerative agriculture (and regenerative Internet) can provide for a sustainable form of value creation.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar/Tanzania have enough natural resources to be independent for its own direct needs. Healthy, non GMO-modified food is the future for a better world.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We are buying 100.000 square meters or more of farming land in Zanzibar and +5.000.000 square meters of farming land in Tanzania, with the purpose to protect and provide value for the Tanzania and Zanzibar communities. This land will be protected property, and can never be abused in any possible way. The land can only be used for regenerative organic farming, working with and empowering local communities to build a resilient and prosperous local supply chain, education projects dealing with regenerative farming and Internet, research projects and programs experimenting with the best regenerative food and agriculture practices, conscious living in mobile structures in balance with organic farming, keeping the benefit of the farming in Zanzibar for the people of Zanzibar, and the farming of Internet capacity for the local community. People who live around the Farming projects can find work and education on the land.

### Zanzibar Villas & Apartments

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar, in our opinion, is one of the most fantastic locations in the world, and we have the option to acquire some remaining beautiful beach plots. One example is Michamvi, close to Paje. It is an amazing spot on the island, with incredible hotels and stunning beaches. Low tide gives room for a huge beach with clean white sand, and it's also home to mangroves just next to our location. We have 20.000 square meters at the beach and 10.000 square meters on a hilltop with stunning views of the sea. This is a perfect place to live parts of the year or relax after a stay at our (future) healing clinic or resort on the other side of the island.
