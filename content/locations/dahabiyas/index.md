### Egypt Nile River

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
The Nile is not only gorgeous but also an incredibly energy-rich location. The river has always played an important role in global shifting situations.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We operate 4 boats on the Nile in the original Dahabiya style. Each boat has solar and is made as organic as possible. The Nile is an incredibly fertile area in Africa and is fundamental for the survival of millions of people, today it's not going well enough, education and concrete action is needed now.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Our Impact activities for Egypt include knowledge-creation and awareness education for the farmers along the Nile, farming projects for organic food and hemp to show the economic feasibility, carbon credit harvesting, practical digital education material, stopping the pollution of the Nile and the burning of sugar cane, and inviting experts to come and stay at our facilities to do practical research and help create educational content.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Today already we have four boats (movable platforms for authentic experiences) with a 30-person team. The boats together total 44 sleeping rooms and 4 educational rooms, along with solar energy and water filtration.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
We're leveraging these boats for the expansion of OurWorld Ecosystem and beyond. Train the Trainer (two-week) sessions will permit us to train those who feel the calling around OurWorld, and allow them to go into the world, advocate, and expand our communities. Additionally, we organize retreats for investors, business people, and change-makers on the Nile, an extremely powerful energy instrument.
</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Ultimately, we want to empower any other changemakers to use our platform and organize events â€“ it's proven to be incredibly impactful.
