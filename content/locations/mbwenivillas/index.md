### Mbweni Villas & Apartments, Zanzibar, Tanzania

<p style='font-size: 15px'>
Zanzibar, in our opinion, is one of the most fantastic locations in the world, and we have the option to acquire some remaining beautiful beach plots. One example is Michamvi, close to Paje. It is an amazing spot on the island, with incredible hotels and stunning beaches. Low tide gives room for a huge beach with clean white sand, and it's also home to mangroves just next to our location. We have 20.000 square meters at the beach and 10.000 square meters on a hilltop with stunning views of the sea. This is a perfect place to live parts of the year or relax after a stay at our (future) healing clinic or resort on the other side of the island.
