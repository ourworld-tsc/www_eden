## Protection Program 

### Regenerative Planet and People First Approach

By creating our own paradise we have a responsibility to the planet and we support 4 initial projects:

### Chumbe Island

<p style='font-size: 15px'>The following project activities will ensure that conservation management on Chumbe Island will continue, even though the eco-lodge still has limited bookings, and address the urgent threat on the marine park, Chumbe staff, and local fishing communities:
</p>

- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Vital enforcement of a 55 ha no-take Coral Reef Sanctuary and a 17 ha Closed Forest Reserve and improvements in MPA patrols in order to safeguard Chumbe’s unique biodiversity and reduce the prevailing risk of wildlife poaching.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Continuous protection of crucial biodiversity for the East African region and preservation of Chumbe’s important function as a fisheries nursery ground benefiting fishing communities through spillover and restocking of adjacent fishing grounds. </p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Continued full-time employment of the experienced conservation team who will implement optimal patrol efficiency and monitoring. </p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Deployment of two additional security officers to assist with the enforcement and upholding of both protected areas during the worsening economic times.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Continuation of the environmental education program with key fishing communities.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Skills development of local youth from key target fishing villages to be trained as rangers.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>What will be achieved?</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>This project will allow for full patrol operations over the coming 12 months which will decrease poaching attempts inside the MPA and subsequently ensure that 25 years of successful conservation efforts are not lost. Eight Chumbe rangers will receive full-time employment for the whole project duration, each supporting on average 12 dependents in their local communities. Zanzibari community members from neighboring fishing villages will gain knowledge and practical insights in nature conservation through Chumbe’s extensive environmental education program which will positively impact compliance to marine protected area regulations.</p>

### Mbweni Ruins

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Mbweni, 5km south of Zanzibar Town, was a Universities Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) base and settlement for former slaves in the 19th century. The ruins of St Mary’s School for Girls, built by missionaries for girls freed from slave ships, is now set amid the lush gardens of Mbweni Ruins.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>The Historic Ruins of the Mbweni School for freed slaves founded in 1874, with associations with Sir John Kirk, Zanzibar’s first scientific botanist. Kirk (1832 – 1922) was also instrumental in the ending of the East African Slave Trade. He was resident in Zanzibar for 20 years from 1866-1886.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Near Mbweni Ruins is St John's Anglican Church, another thought-provoking reminder of the colonial missionary era. The caretaker-guide is a direct descendant of a freed slave who became the UMCA's first African deacon (junior priest).</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Our aim is to restore the ruins to its old glory and revive it as an education center. We will also integrate the old church.</p>

### Mbweni Botanical Garden & Restoration Project

<p style='font-size: 15px'>The gardens around the ruins are super beautiful, they are being revived to become even more majestic. The garden is a beautiful and mature garden with many fine tree specimens and other interesting plants. Many mature trees that were propagated from the original garden of Kirk, which is now the nearby residence of the former Zanzibar President Amani Abeid Karume.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Its mature and rainforest (jungle) atmosphere is only found in a few other places in Zanzibar and Pemba. Areas of native plants, specifically coral rag forest on the cliff and mangroves on the shoreline.</p>

#### Planned activities: 

- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Secure and curate the mature garden that is well stocked with unique plants.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Create a space for local nature especially native plants but also butterflies and birds.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Create a space for quiet learning about the history of the garden, the plants, and what is needed to be “nature positive”.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Create a space for art including sculptures, installations, and performance that relates to the history of the garden.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Create a space that the owners and clients of the Mbweni Ruins find inspiring and in which they can be proud.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Share knowledge of good plant care and management with other landowners and hotels.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Mbweni Ruins can be linked with other plant sites such as Chumbe Island and Kilimani Botanic garden that can be interfaces for plant-related activities.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Presenting history and knowledge: There is much history and knowledge about the garden and the site which can be built into a solid story that can be presented on-site. The ruins themselves make a unique venue for presenting that history and knowledge.</p>

#### Deliverables:

- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Research, design, and planning. This will include collating the scattered information and interviewing key people. Contacting Flo Montgomery and learning from her the history of the 1990s garden creation.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Create an up-to-date plant list by tracking down old plant lists and comparing them with what is present today. Carry out a comprehensive survey of current plants in the garden.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Training: Mbweni gardeners are trained in immediate garden recovery and the importance of key species.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Garden Map: An accurate map of the garden showing the locations of the main trees.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>Garden Vision and Plan: A detailed garden vision and management plan with a road map for achieving it.</p>
- <p style='font-size: 15px'>History and Art display research and concept development.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>The team is led by Robert Wild and John Ndege. They will source mapping skills and support labor.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Robert Wild, Social Ecologist: Robert has lived and worked in East Africa for over 30 years. He was a technical advisor for the establishment of Jozani Chwaka Bay National park, Zanzibar from 1995-2000. From 2014 to 2018 he was Regional Technical Coordinator for the Eastern and Southern Africa Region (30 countries) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature for Forests and Drylands based in Nairobi. He was responsible for forests and drylands, and led the regional effort of forest and landscape restoration. During this period Zanzibar was his home base. He returned to Zanzibar full time in 2019. He knows many local actors in the nature, history, arts and hospitality communities.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>John Ndege, Botanist. John is a botanist with extensive experience of East African Coastal Botany and botanic gardens. He has lived and worked in Zanzibar for 5 years. He carried out a survey of the plants of Mbweni Ruins in 2019. Most recently he has been the technical lead and project manager of the Kilimani Botanic Garden 2018-2020. He was employed by Potsdam Botanic Garden, Germany.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>He is the most experienced active botanist on Zanzibar and an expert in the local and very biodiverse Dwarf Tropical Dry Forest (known as Coral Rag Forest, the best example of this locally is on Chumbe Island). He has discovered species new to science. </p>

### Mbweni Mangrove Beach

​<p style='font-size: 15px'>​5200 Seedlings of Mangroves Replanted at Mbweni.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>This effort helps the Wanawake Mazingira Group and a number of partners in assuring the desired goal of 10,000 Mangroves for 100 years of carbon offset.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>Mbweni Mangrove forest is a vital periurban forest just at the edge of Dar es Salaam and Coastal region, and there is a degraded area as a result of El Nino of the late 1990s, where a lot of waterlogged at the mangroves and nearly 2 acres died.</p>

<p style='font-size: 15px'>We are restoring the degraded part of Mbweni mangrove forest with 10,000 Mangrove seedlings through community-based restoration, since March 2018 and up to the moment we have restored 5200 seedlings.</p>
