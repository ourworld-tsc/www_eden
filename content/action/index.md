## Calling Dreamers & Doers

### A Dream Becomes Reality

There are many ways to join in on the efforts to bring the vision to life. Come to Zanzibar to collaborate in-person, buy EDN (below), or support from afar. Today we are already operating from this location and making initial steps.

Our primary focus is on **raising $4M USD by June 2023** in order to take on full ownership and finance the project. We cannot do this without the support of like-minded believers.

# A Token for Co-Ownership

We are introducing a token called EDN. EDN Tokens are not crypto currencies, they are pre-purchase tokens of Eden and represent ownership/utilization in the ecosystem. You can always re-sell your EDN tokens or use them to participate in the Eden universe.

# Not For Profit

The Eden locations will be owned by not-for-profit entities to make sure that all stays protected for ever. All assets are owned by non profits but the utilization is 100% for Eden for 33-66-99 years (renewable). This allows us to create value for the future of our planet and ourselves.

# A Bigger Picture

Eden is part of a much bigger picture focused on planet and people first principles. We collectively believe that doing business and doing good for the world can go hand in hand.
