## Mbweni Ruins
 
### Activities

The ruins of St Mary’s School for Girls, built by missionaries for girls freed from slave ships, are set amidst the lush botanical gardens. These ruins, representing freedom and sovereignty, will be restored as part of our protection programs – and we will introduce educational tours. In the meantime, you are invited to walk through these beautiful structures.
