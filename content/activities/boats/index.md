## On the Water
 
### Activities

We are boat lovers ourselves and have several boats available for day trips. One is a 35 year-old wooden 60-foot Turkish sailing boat with four sails. Another is a 30-year old smaller catamaran which is all wood and has no bolts – it's a very specific design and sails beautifully. We also have a faster boat when speed is of the essence.
