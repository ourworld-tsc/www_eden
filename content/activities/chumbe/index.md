## Chumbe Island
 
### Activities

Friends of Eden, Chumbe Island is one of the world's most successful ecotourism projects. In 1994 the reef surrounding Chumbe island was created as Tanzania's first Marine National Park. The island itself, covered with lush mangrove forest, is a designated forest reserve. Trips to Chumbe leave from our property each day.
