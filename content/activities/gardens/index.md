## Botanical Gardens
 
### Activities

Our gardens are part of a mature and rainforest (jungle) atmosphere which is only found in a few other places in Zanzibar and Pemba. Home to hundreds of species of plants and trees, many endemic to Zanzibar, it's a beautiful place to take a stroll or take it easy. We're working on educational signage and guided tours, coming this year.
