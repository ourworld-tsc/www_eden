## Our Why 

### Planet. People. Authenticity.

These values are engrained into all that we do. Mother Earth is our home and we must protect her. Beyond that, we believe in people and the power of community and we aim to support the people around us. A healthy community starts with authenticity and the opportunity to be our authentic selves. We want people to experience peaceful free time with detail for art, nature, silence, food, and healing. We want to show people the beauty of our world – which is a real paradise – and help them find themselves again in this hectic world. We want to preserve unique locations and create awareness on why this is so important. And finally we aim to educate around planet regeneration and sustainability, awareness improvement, sovereignty, and more.

### Who We Are

<p>We are an international group of believers in a better world who choose to act to make whatever difference we can. We are dreamers and doers. Our core “ownership” group is focused on building out a decentralized Internet owned by the people – a safe, fair, and equal Internet offering private and secure digital tools and experiences. It is a big journey, and a journey we are deeply devoted to.</p>

<p>Africa is a continent which has been exploited for centuries, robbed of its culture and its resources. We came to Zanzibar and Tanzania to bring our technology here, to help reverse the story of this country and the wider continent.</p>

<p>Together with local people of Zanzibar and Tanzania and foreigners alike, we are creating a safe space for us all, while protecting our mother earth.</p>

<p>If you’d like to learn more about our efforts and who we are, please get in touch with us.</p>

### Our Manifesto

<p>Jungle Paradise is a home for all of us. A laid-back no frills environment that allows us to slow down, get back in touch with mother nature, and with ourselves. Jungle Paradise is a raw and safe space for collaboration and co-creation, for imagination and celebration.</p>

- We say hello (jambo) to each other and offer a warm smile
- We treat each other with kindness and do not discriminate
- We choose love over fear, and we act out of love
- We respect nature and we leave no trace
- We consume fresh and healthy food, local when possible
- We share experiences and stories
- We do not enter rooms without shoes on

<p>This list is incomplete and a work in progress. :)</p>

### Mbweni Mangrove Beach

​<p>​5,200 Seedlings of Mangroves Replanted at Mbweni.</p>

<p>This effort helps the Wanawake Mazingira Group and a number of partners in assuring the desired goal of 10,000 Mangroves for 100 years of carbon offset.</p>

<p>Mbweni Mangrove forest is a vital periurban forest just at the edge of Dar es Salaam and Coastal region, and there is a degraded area as a result of El Nino of the late 1990s, where a lot of waterlogged at the mangroves and nearly 2 acres died.</p>

<p>We are restoring the degraded part of Mbweni mangrove forest with 10,000 Mangrove seedlings through community-based restoration, since March 2018 and up to the moment we have restored 5,200 seedlings.</p>
