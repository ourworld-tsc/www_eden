## About Us

### Dreamers and Doers

We are fortunate enough to have found this special place and crazy enough to turn our dreams into reality. Together we can show people the beauty of our world and help them find themselves in these hectic times.

### Who We Are

<p>We are an international group of believers in a better world who choose to act to make whatever difference we can. We are dreamers and doers. Today, we operate out of the Seaview Apartments and have taken over ownership of the Jungle Paradise Hotel as of January 2023.</p>

<p>

Primarily we are focused on building **[a decentralized Internet](https://threefold.io) (ThreeFold)** owned by the people – a safe, fair, and equal Internet offering private and secure digital tools and experiences. It is a big journey, and a journey we are deeply devoted to.

</p>

<p>

*"The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world."*

</p>

<p>Africa is a continent which has been exploited for centuries, robbed of its culture and its resources. We came to Zanzibar and Tanzania to bring our technology here, to help do what we can to reverse the story of this country and the wider continent.</p>

<p>We believe that collaboration is the key to a better future. So, together we are creating our own little paradise, a safe space for like-minded people, while supporting the local community and protecting our mother earth.</p>

### Our Manifesto

<p>OurParadise is a home for all of us. A laid-back no frills environment that allows us to slow down, get back in touch with mother nature, and with ourselves. OurParadise is a raw and safe space for collaboration and co-creation, for imagination and celebration.</p>

- We say hello to each other and offer a warm smile
- We treat each other with kindness and do not discriminate
- We choose love over fear, and we act out of love
- We collaborate and support each others' missions
- We respect nature and we leave no trace
- We consume fresh and healthy food, local when possible
- We share experiences and stories – and sunsets
- We do not enter rooms with shoes on

<p>This list is evolving. Let us know what else you'd like to see.</p>
