## About Us

### Dreamers and Doers

We are fortunate enough to have found this special place and bold enough to turn our dreams into reality. Together we can show people the beauty of our world and help them find themselves in these hectic times.

### Who We Are

<p>We are an international group of believers in a better world who choose to act to make whatever difference we can. We are dreamers and doers. Today, we operate out of the Seaview Apartments and have taken over ownership of the Jungle Paradise Hotel as of January 2023.</p>

<p>

Primarily we are focused on building **[a decentralized Internet](https://threefold.io) (ThreeFold)** owned by the people – a safe, fair, and equal Internet offering private and secure digital tools and experiences. It is a big journey, and a journey we are deeply devoted to.

</p>

<p>

*"The fight for a better Internet is inseparable from the fight for a better world."*

</p>

<p>Africa is a continent which has been exploited for centuries, robbed of its culture and its resources. We came to Zanzibar and Tanzania to bring our technology here, to help do what we can to reverse the story of this country and the wider continent.</p>

<p>We believe that collaboration is the key to a better future. So, together we are creating our own little paradise, a safe space for like-minded people, while supporting the local community and protecting our mother earth.</p>

### Our Why

<br>

<p>Planet-First. People-First. Authenticity. These values are engrained into all that we do.</p>

<p>Mother Earth is our home and we must protect her. Beyond that, we believe in people and the power of community and we aim to support and empower the people around us. A healthy community starts with authenticity and the opportunity to be our authentic selves.</p>

<p>We want people to experience peaceful free time with detail for art, nature, silence, food, and healing. We want to show people the beauty of our world – which is a real paradise – and help them find themselves again in this hectic world. We want to preserve unique locations and create awareness on why this is so important.</p>

<p>And finally we aim to educate around planet regeneration and sustainability, awareness improvement, sovereignty, and more.</p>

### Our Manifesto

<p>OurParadise is a home for all of us. A laid-back no frills environment that allows us to slow down, get back in touch with mother nature, and with ourselves. OurParadise is a raw and safe space for collaboration and co-creation, for imagination and celebration.</p>

- We say hello to each other and offer a warm smile
- We treat each other with kindness and do not discriminate
- We choose love over fear, and we act out of love
- We collaborate and support each others' missions
- We respect nature and we leave no trace
- We consume fresh and healthy food, local when possible
- We share experiences and stories – and sunsets
- We do not enter rooms with shoes on

<p>This list is evolving. Let us know what else you'd like to see.</p>
