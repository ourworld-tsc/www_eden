## About Us

### Dreamers and Doers

We are fortunate enough to have found this special place and crazy enough to turn our dreams into reality. Together we can show people the beauty of our world and help them find themselves in these hectic times.

### Who We Are

<p>

We are an international group of believers in a better world who choose to act to make whatever difference we can. We are dreamers and doers. Primarily we are focused on building out **[a decentralized Internet](https://threefold.io)** owned by the people â€“ a safe, fair, and equal Internet offering private and secure digital tools and experiences. It is a big journey, and a journey we are deeply devoted to.

</p>

<p>Africa is a continent which has been exploited for centuries, robbed of its culture and its resources. We came to Zanzibar and Tanzania to bring our technology here, to help reverse the story of this country and the wider continent.</p>

<p>Together with local people of Zanzibar and Tanzania and foreigners alike, we are creating a safe space for us all, while protecting our mother earth.</p>

### Our Manifesto

<p>OurParadise is a home for all of us. A laid-back no frills environment that allows us to slow down, get back in touch with mother nature, and with ourselves. OurParadise is a raw and safe space for collaboration and co-creation, for imagination and celebration.</p>

- We say hello (jambo) to each other and offer a warm smile
- We treat each other with kindness and do not discriminate
- We choose love over fear, and we act out of love
- We respect nature and we leave no trace
- We consume fresh and healthy food, local when possible
- We share experiences and stories
- We do not enter rooms without shoes on

<p>This list is incomplete and a work in progress. :)</p>
