 ## Welcome to OurParadise
 
 ### A Co-Owned Abundance-Based System

 <br>

 Our mission is to conserve and protect unique locations around the world by promoting eco-tourism and eco-education and the preservation and empowerment of local cultures, starting in Zanzibar and Tanzania.<br><br>We strive to raise awareness of the importance of environmental and cultural conservation, and to inspire people to take action to regenerate our planet and to protect, empower, and learn from local peoples and their traditions.

 <!-- What if we together create a new "paradise” system not based on scarcity and fear of missing out, but based on trust and abundance? An interconnected network of homes where we can always go to find healing, like-minded people, and safety. -->

### Crafts

Learn from locals how to produce crafts, from ceramics to clothing and wood-working. In this way, we can promote and support the conservation of Zanzibarian practices and create beautiful products at the same time.

## Protectors of Paradise

By creating our own paradise we have a responsibility to the planet. As such, we have four initial projects to ensure the conservation and regeneration of OurParadise – Chumbe Island, Mbweni Ruins, Mbweni Botanical Gardens, and the Mbweni Mangrove Forest.
