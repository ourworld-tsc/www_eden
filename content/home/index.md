 ## Welcome to OurParadise
 
 ### A Co-Owned Abundance-Based System

 <br>

 Our mission is to conserve and protect unique locations by promoting eco-tourism and education. <br> We strive to raise awareness of the importance of environmental conservation  <br> and to inspire people to take action to regenerate our planet.

 <!-- What if we together create a new "paradise” system not based on scarcity and fear of missing out, but based on trust and abundance? An interconnected network of homes where we can always go to find healing, like-minded people, and safety. -->

By creating our own paradise we have a responsibility to the planet. As such, we have four initial projects to ensure the conservation and regeneration of OurParadise – Chumbe Island, Mbweni Ruins, Mbweni Botanical Gardens, and the Mbweni Mangrove Forest.
